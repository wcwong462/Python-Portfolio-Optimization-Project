# Portfolio Optimization Project

## Overview

This project implements a portfolio optimization model aimed at maximizing the Sharpe ratio for a diversified long-only investment portfolio. It calculates optimal asset weights to achieve an efficient balance between expected return and risk by utilising historical price data for selected ETFs.

Tkinter GUI are generated by Github Copilot

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and modeling.
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - yfinance: To retrieve historical market data.
  - numpy: For numerical calculations.
  - fredapi: To access economic data from the Federal Reserve.
  - scipy: For optimization routines.

## Key Concepts

- **Portfolio Theory**: The project applies modern portfolio theory to determine an optimal asset allocation.
- **Sharpe Ratio**: The model maximizes the Sharpe ratio to improve risk-adjusted returns.
- **Log Returns**: It utilizes log returns to represent asset performance accurately.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Install the required libraries using pip:

### Setting Up Your Environment
- Clone the Repository (if applicable):

#### Obtain a FRED API Key:
- Sign up for an account at FRED and request your API key.
- Update the API Key in the Code:
- In the main script, replace the placeholder API key with your actual API key:
- fred = Fred(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

## Acknowledgments
- Yahoo Finance API: For providing historical market data.
- FRED API: For offering economic data and indicators.
- Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.


## Step By Step Work Flow
1. User Input:

  The user opens the GUI and is prompted to enter stock or ETF tickers in a comma-separated format.
  Data Fetching:
  
  Upon clicking the "Optimize Portfolio" button, the system reads the input tickers.
  It calls the fetch_data function to download historical closing prices for the specified tickers using the yfinance library.
  The function handles errors and checks if data is available for each ticker.
  Data Processing:
  
  The system calculates daily logarithmic returns based on the fetched closing prices.
  It computes the covariance matrix of these returns, which is essential for assessing the risk of different asset combinations.
  Risk-Free Rate:
  
  The system retrieves the 10-year Treasury yield from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API to determine the risk-free rate, which 
  is used in the Sharpe ratio calculation.
  
2. Portfolio Optimization:

  The optimization process is defined using several functions:
  Portfolio Deviation: Calculates the portfolio's volatility based on asset weights and the covariance matrix.
  Portfolio Return: Estimates the expected return based on the weights of the assets.
  Negative Portfolio Sharpe Ratio: This function is minimized to find the optimal asset weights that maximize the Sharpe ratio.
  Constraints ensure that the sum of the weights equals 1 (fully invested portfolio), and bounds restrict weights between 0 and 1.
  Optimization Execution:
  
  The minimize function from scipy.optimize is used to solve the optimization problem.
  If successful, the optimized weights, expected annual return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio are calculated.
  Output Display:
  
  The results are formatted and displayed in the GUI's text area, showing the optimized weights for each asset, expected return, expected 
  volatility, and Sharpe ratio.
